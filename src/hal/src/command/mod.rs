//! Command buffers.
//!
//! A command buffer collects a list of commands to be submitted to the device.
//! Each command buffer has specific capabilities for graphics, compute or transfer operations,
//! and can be either a "primary" command buffer or a "secondary" command buffer.  Operations
//! always start from a primary command buffer, but a primary command buffer can contain calls
//! to secondary command buffers that contain snippets of commands that do specific things, similar
//! to function calls.
//!
//! All the possible commands are implemented in the `RawCommandBuffer` trait, and then the `CommandBuffer`
//! and related types make a generic, strongly-typed wrapper around it that only expose the methods that
//! are valid for the capabilities it provides.

// TODO: Document pipelines and subpasses better.
